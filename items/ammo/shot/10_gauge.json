    "description": "The 10 gauge Shotshell is similar to its 12 gauge counterpart. It isn't has common though, in part to it being more limited in its applications. The notable diffrences between the two gauges is that the shell for a 10 gauge tends to be green opposed to red. The other fact is that the 10 gauge is catered towards bird hunting. While it isn't *as* useful for self defense, it still can be used to hunt or to shoot zombies.",
